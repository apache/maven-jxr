Maven JXR

 Maven JXR project (formally Java Cross Reference) is a library to analyze a set of Java
 source files and produces documentation in HTML format <Ã  la Javadoc>.

 Take a look at this {{{./xref/index.html}JXR report}} to see an example.

* Main Features

 * Supports JDK 1.4+

 * Complementary tool for Javadoc

 * Easy configuration for color, style or template

 * Fully integrated with {{{./maven-jxr-plugin/}Maven}}

* Brief History

 The original JXR code was merged in 2004 with the Javasrc project from the defunct
 {{{http://jakarta.apache.org/alexandria}Jakarta Alexandria}} project.
 The code was first maintained within the Maven 1 JXR plugin. In September 2005, it
 was voted to fork the base and create a separate library.

* Examples

   The following example shows how to use Maven JXR in more advanced use cases:
